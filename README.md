# Different Locks Implementation

We have implemented following locks:

1. Test-And-Set Lock (TAS)
2. Test-And-Test-And-Set Lock (TTAS)
3. Anderson Lock (ALock)
4. CLH Lock
5. MCS Lock

### How to Run?

1. In `main.cpp` select the number of threads and then `make run`.

### Files in directory

1. `main.cpp`: for testing the locks
2. `header/`: directory containing header files for different locks
3. `locks/`: directory containing implementation of different locks
4. `aux/`: files for testing some assembly code (ASM)
